# ðŸ“ˆ Sales Prediction â€“ CodSoft Internship Task

This is Task 3 of my **Data Science Internship at CodSoft**.  
In this project, I built a **Simple Linear Regression** model to predict product sales based on the advertising budget spent on TV marketing.

## ðŸ“Œ Task Overview

- **Task Name:** Sales Prediction
- **Internship:** CodSoft â€“ Data Science Internship
- **Tools Used:** Python, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, scikit-learn
- **Model Used:** Simple Linear Regression

---

## ðŸ§  Problem Statement

Businesses need to forecast product sales based on their advertising strategies.  
This project aims to predict **sales figures** using **TV advertising spend** as the feature.

## ðŸ“Š Dataset

- ðŸ“„ Dataset Source: [Kaggle â€“ Sales Prediction Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/code/ashydv/sales-prediction-simple-linear-regression/input)
- Columns:
  - `TV`: TV advertising budget
  - `Sales`: Product sales

---

## ðŸ”§ Steps Involved

1. Import and explore the dataset
2. Visualize the relationship between TV budget and Sales
3. Split the data into training and test sets
4. Build and train a **Linear Regression** model
5. Evaluate the model using **MSE** and **RÂ² score**
6. Visualize predicted vs actual results

---

## âœ… Results

- **Final Model Accuracy (RÂ² Score):** ~85â€“90%
- Evaluation done using:
  - `mean_squared_error`
  - `r2_score`
