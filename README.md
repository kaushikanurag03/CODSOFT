# ðŸš¢ Titanic Survival Prediction â€“ CodSoft Internship Task

This project is part of my Data Science Internship at **CodSoft**.  
The goal is to build a machine learning model that predicts whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster, based on features like age, gender, ticket class, and more.

## ðŸ“Œ Task Overview

- **Task Name:** Titanic Survival Prediction
- **Internship:** CodSoft â€“ Data Science Internship
- **Tools Used:** Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, scikit-learn
- **Algorithm:** Logistic Regression

---

## ðŸ§  Problem Statement

Using historical data from the Titanic disaster, the objective is to predict whether a passenger survived or not. The model is trained using a supervised machine learning approach (binary classification).

## ðŸ“Š Dataset

- Source: [Kaggle â€“ Titanic Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserh/titanic-dataset)
- File used: `train.csv`

---

## ðŸ”§ Steps Involved

1. Data Loading and Exploration
2. Data Cleaning (handling missing values, dropping irrelevant features)
3. Feature Encoding (Sex, Embarked)
4. Train-Test Split
5. Model Training (Logistic Regression)
6. Model Evaluation (Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, Classification Report)

---

## âœ… Results

- Final Model Accuracy: **~78â€“80%**
- Model evaluated using `accuracy_score`, `confusion_matrix`, and `classification_report`.
